We have processed all data on employee compensation and generated an Excel file (Equality Table.xlsx, available in the Resources) containing 3 columns:

Factory
Job Role
Equality Score (integer; ranging between -100 and +100; 0 is ideal)
Here is your task:

Create a 4th column (Equality class), classifying the equality score into 3 types:
Fair (+-10)
Unfair (<-10 AND >10)
Highly Discriminative (<-20 AND >20)
